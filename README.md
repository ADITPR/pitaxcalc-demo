Getting Started
---------------

If you want to **propose code changes**, follow the directions in the
[Tax-Calculator Contributor
Guide](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor_guide.html)
on how to clone the pitaxcalc-demo git repository.  Before developing
any code changes be sure to read completely the Contributor Guide and
then read about our [coding style](CODING.md) and [testing
procedures](TESTING.md).  You may find this [git
cheat sheet](SIMPLE_GIT_USAGE.md) useful in preparing a GitHub pull
request that contains your proposed code changes.

The pitaxcalc-demo [release history](RELEASES.md) provides a summary
of past development work.
